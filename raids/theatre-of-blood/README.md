# Theatre of Blood (ToB)

The Theatre Of Blood is a high-level raid you can do for some good loot. You get faster, and better, at ToB after more attempts and KC.

You can do the Theatre of Blood using `/raid tob start`

You can specify a maximum number of people to join the raid using `/raid tob start`` `**`max_team_size:`**

To start a hard mode tob raid, use `/raid tob start`` `**`hard_mode:`**` ``true`

You can see your KC, attempts and death chances using `/raid tob stats`

You can find a team to do ToB in the official server at discord.gg/ob

## Boosts

### Speed Boosts

There are no direct speed boosts, these items affect your boost score (see theory section).

* Better darts directly affect your boost score rather than your gear score.
* Having more attempts/KC
* Scythe > Blade > Tentacle (in melee outfit)
* Twisted bow (in range outfit)
* Dragon warhammer > Bandos godsword (in bank)
* Penalty for not having elite void, bigger penalty for not having normal void either.
* Dragon claws > Crystal halberd (in bank)

### Death Reduction

* Having more attempts/KC
* Having better gear



## Blowpipe, Abyssal Tentacle, Sanguinesti staff and Scythe of Vitur

To charge your Blowpipe use:

* `+m bp add 100 dragon dart, 1000 zulrah's scales`

To create or charge an Abyssal tentacle use:&#x20;

* `/create`` `**`item:`**` ``Abyssal tentacle`
* `/minion charge`` `**`item:`**` ``Abyssal tentacle`` `**`amount:`**` ``1`

To charge your Sanguinesti Staff use:

* `/minion charge`` `**`item:`**` ``Sanguinesti staff`` `**`amount:`**` ``10000`

The Scythe isn't charged. It is created from an uncharged scythe with `/create`` `**`item:`**`Scythe of vitur` and uses blood runes/vials of blood as you use it.
