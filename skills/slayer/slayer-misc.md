# Misc Info & FAQ

### FAQ

**Q: How do I use an unsired / Chewed bones?**  
A: `+offer unsired` / `+offer chewed bones`

### Best gear for slayer

This can vary slightly depending on your task but in general this is the best gear.  
**Melee:** Yes, bulwark is better than ely.

![An imbued warrior ring is slightly better](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png)

**Range:** Note that kodai wand ****will still provide infinite water runes when equipped in your range setup.

![Black/God/3rd age vamb&apos;s would be better than bgloves](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%288%29.png)

It's recommended you create a gear preset for these setups after equipping them. I.E.  
`+gearpresets new meleeslay melee`  
`+gearpresets new rangeslay range`  
Equip the preset with:  
`+gearpresets equip meleeslay melee`

### Konar specific

Konar assigns tasks to specific locations, you can use any location that Konar can assign in game. For example Konar assigns black demons in both the catacombs and taverly dungeon, allowing you to use a cannon or not use a cannon to receive ancient shards/totem pieces. Konar does not however assign the area for demonic gorillas meaning these won't count towards a black demon task.

_In simpler terms..._  
Konar assigns tasks to specific locations, slightly different to in game. Therefore you may not be able to kill your relevant task’s ‘boss’ counterparts or use a cannon/barrage.
