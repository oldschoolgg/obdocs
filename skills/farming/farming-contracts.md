# Farming Contracts

An easy way to get additional seeds while farming is to take on a [farming contract](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Guildmaster_Jane#Farming_contracts) from Farming Guildmaster Jane using the `+farmingcontract <tier>` command. You can take easy contracts at 45 Farming, medium contracts at 65 Farming, and hard contracts at 85 Farming. Guildmaster Jane will ask you to grow a crop suitable for your farming level, and upon successfully harvesting the requested crop you will be given a seed pack. If your contract is too difficult, you can use the `+fc easier` command to have Jane downgrade your contract to the next lowest tier. After completing your contract, you must use the `+seedpack` command to get your rewards.
