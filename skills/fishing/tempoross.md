# Tempoross

&#x20;With at least 35 Fishing, you can send your minion out with /`tempoross` (or `+temp`/`+ross`).&#x20;

All rewards are dropped as your minion returns, no need to fish the reward pool.&#x20;

Spirit angler can be acquired with /`create`, but provides no additional boost over normal anglers.&#x20;

Important boosts: Crystal harpoon for XP, Infernal Harpoon for rewards. Both need to be equipped in your skilling gear. Dragon harpoon also works but is a strictly worse version of the Infernal Harpoon.
