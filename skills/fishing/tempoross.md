# Tempoross

&#x20;With at least 35 Fishing, you can send your minion out with `/k`**`name:`**`Tempoross`.&#x20;

All rewards are dropped as your minion returns, no need to fish the reward pool.&#x20;

Spirit angler can be acquired with `/create`, but provides no additional boost over normal anglers.&#x20;

**Important boosts:** Crystal harpoon for XP, Infernal Harpoon for rewards. Either needs to be equipped in your skilling gear. Dragon harpoon also works but is a strictly worse version of the Infernal Harpoon.
