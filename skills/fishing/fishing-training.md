# Fishing Training

## Fastest route to 99:

`/fish`` `**`name:`**`Shrimps` from 1-5\
`/fish`` `**`name:`**`Sardine` from 5-10 (requires fishing bait)\
`/fish`` `**`name:`**`Herring` from 10-20 (requires fishing bait)\
**OPTIONAL**: Fishing Trawler for Angler outfit\
`/fish`` `**`name:`**`Trout` from 20-30 (requires feathers)\
`/fish`` `**`name:`**`Salmon` from 30-58 (requires feathers)\
**OPTIONAL**: Aerial Fishing (reqs minimum 35 hunter) for Pearl barbarian rod\
`/fish`` `**`name:`**`Barbarian fishing` from 58-99 (requires feathers)

[Tempoross](tempoross.md) is a good option instead of Barbarian Fishing once you have obtained a crystal tool seed from Zalcano and a Dragon harpoon from Wyrms or Tempoross to create a crystal harpoon. Requires 35 fishing.

### Additional Information:

[Aerial Fishing](aerial-fishing.md) when at least 43 fishing/35 hunter, this is much better than doing Hunting or Fishing on their own for training if you're looking to get 99 in both.

**Collection Log Slots obtainable by Fishing**

Bass (Big Bass), Swordfish (Big Swordfish), Shark (Big Shark), [Fishing Trawler](fishing-trawler.md) (Angler outfit), [Aerial Fishing](aerial-fishing.md) (3 Rods+Golden Tench+Fish Sack).
