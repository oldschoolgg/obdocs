## Training Methods

Agility can be trained by using the command `+laps [quantity] <course>`. For example: `+laps 10 canifis`.

### Rooftop Agility

Rooftop agility courses reward the player with marks of grace which can be used to buy pieces of the Graceful outfit, using the command `+create graceful` or `+create graceful <piece>`, and amylase packs using the command `+buy [quantity] amylase pack`, which will give you 100 amylase crystals per amylase pack costing 10 marks of grace each.

### [Hallowed Sepulchre](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/hallowed-sepulchre)

From level 52 agility, the player may train agility using the command `+sepulchre`, which also requires full Graceful equipped in your skilling setup. You will progressively get better at plundering the sepulchre as your agility level increases, peaking at 92 agility.

The Brimhaven Agility Arena rewards the player with Agility tickets which can be used to purchase cosmetic rewards or agility XP, using the command `+agilityarena`.
