# Thieving

## Thieving

You can train thieving using the `+pickpocket` command. For example, you can `+pickpocket master farmer`. To start training Thieving, you can `+pickpocket man` or `woman`. You will obtain the standard loot from each monster you can pickpocket, all of which can be found on the [OSRS Thieving Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Thieving).
