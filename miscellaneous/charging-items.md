# Charging Items

There are a number of degradable items that must be charged in order to be used or provide a boost for certain bosses/minigames. The maximum amount of charges on an item is 1,000,000. When charging an item, you can add anywhere between 1-100,000 at a time. Charges on items are generally used anywhere the item provides a boost, or is used in an activity (including regular PvM).

All items can be charged using `/minion charge`` `**`item:`** **`amount:`**&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Most items **cannot** be manually reverted, meaning you need to use the item continually until it runs out of charges to receive the base version again.
