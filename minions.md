Minions are a feature in Old School Bot that let you simulate playing a virtual RuneScape account in Discord. You control a minion, who you send out to do various tasks, like killing monsters for loot, completing clue scrolls, and training skills. With the loot they get, you can craft items, sell them, and trade to other real players.

You can also read the [FAQ](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/faq) for answers to common questions.

> Minions are entirely virtual, and not in any way tradeable for real GP or real money. It's simulating the real game for fun. We strictly do not allow any bot users to break any of the official OSRS rules. Read the rules here: [Old School Bot Rules](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/rules)


If you notice any mistakes or missing information in this page, you can [add it yourself](https://github.com/gc/obdocs/blob/master/minions.md), or report it to us in the [support server](https://discord.gg/ob)

# Getting started

To get started, firstly [read the rules](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/rules), then get yourself a minion by typing `+minion buy`, or `+m buy` for short. If your Discord account is 6 months old or older, your minion will be free. If it is between 1 and 6 months old, your minion will cost 20m. If your account is less than one month old, you are currently unable to purchase a minion as a precaution against alt accounts and bots (unless you become a patron which bypasses this restriction). To get your starting gp, you can use the `+daily` command every 12 hours to get a trivia question you can answer for gp and special Diango items.

Next, decide what you want to do. Skilling? PVM? Questing? Read the rest of the page to see what you can do, and how - and just do whatever you want to do!

It's highly recommended to join the [support server](https://discord.gg/ob) for several reasons: All updates and changes to the bot are announced in the #news channel in the server. We have a #grand-exchange channel you can use to trade/sell items with others. We have a #notifications channel that shows all the rare drops, pets, and other things that people are getting in real time!

 Some bosses have requirements, like Quest points or gear, refer to [Boss and monster requirements](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/minions?Boss%20and%20monster%20requirements) for more information or use the `+monster` command in the bot. 
 
 Don't know what you want to kill? Use the `+m k random` command to send your minion off to kill a random monster, limited to monsters you have the requirements to kill.
  
 You can view your minions' killcounts using `+m kc`.
 
#### Mass Bossing

Some bosses are able to be killed in groups, these bosses currently are: All four GWD bosses, the Nightmare, and Corp - more bosses are planned to be added. 

Note that, similar to ingame, even if you have a very big group of people in a party killing a boss, you're still limited by that bosses respawn time, although the kills can get very very fast if you have lots of people.

Loot is rolled out completely randomly, for example if your party is doing 5 kills, it will give each kill loot to a random party member, the same person can be given loot multiple times, or none at all if unlucky. This does not apply to the Nightmare, where damage dealt is calculated to determine the MvP in accordance with the specific loot mechanics of that boss. 

Currently, boosts do not apply to group boss trips, however this may be added in the future. Unlike gear boosts, patron trip extensions can apply to boss massing. The host of the mass (the player who initiated the mass) is the player checked for patron status.

You **cannot** join parties if: you're an ironman (except for the Nightmare, which Ironmen can join) or if your minion is busy. 

Example of a mass bossing party: `+groupkill mass corp` - this would make a mass party, that anyone can join. The trip will start after 2 minutes automatically, or when the party leader clicks the "start" reaction. 

#### Fight Caves
You can now challenge the Fight Caves and TzTok-Jad to recieve a fire cape, tokkul, and the TzRek-Jad pet using the `+fightcaves` command. Requirements: total +160 range bonus equipped to your range gear setup, 43 prayer, 10x Prayer Potion (4), 4x Super Restore (4), and 6x Saradomin Brew (4) per attempt, some of which may be returned to you should you fail before the final wave. You can make the 4 dose potions from 3, 2, and 1 dose drops using the `+decant` command. Better range gear will reduce the time each attempt takes, as will total Jad kc. Having a Saradomin Godsword equipped in your melee gear setup will reduce your chances of dying before Jad by 4%, and the number of total attempts you have made will determine your chances of killing Jad when he is reached. 

If you have extra fire capes, you can gamble them for an additional roll at the TzRek-Jad pet using the `+capegamble` command. 

#### Equipping Gear
When sending your minion out on boss or skilling trips, you can equip it with gear to improve its speed and effeciency. For convenience, there is a gear setup for melee, range, mage, skilling, and misc. Depending on the activity your minion is doing will depend on which gear is used. For example, taking on the fightcaves uses your minion's **range** gear setup as well as the Saradomin Godsword if it is equipped in your **melee** gear setup. Whereas going mining will use your minion's **skilling** gear setup. You can equip any equippable items you want into the different setups.
When an item is equipped, it is removed from your bank to the gear setup. When unequipped, the item moves back to your bank.

To **equip** an item into a setup, use: `+equip [setup] [item]`. For example, to equip a Bandos chestplate to the melee setup, you would use the command: `+equip melee bandos chestplate`. To **unequip** an item from a setup, use: `+unequip [setup] [item]`. For example: `+unequip melee bandos chestplate`. If you wish to unequip all items in a setup at once, you can use the `+unequipall` setup command. You can also `+autoequip` gear which will, depending on your desired combat style and type, equip the best gear you currently have available. You can `+autoequip melee/range/mage attack/defence crush/stab/slash/ranged/magic`. For example, if you wanted to equip your best magic attack gear in your mage setup, you would `+autoequip mage attack magic`. 

To view your currently equipped gear, use: `+gear [setup]`. For example, to see your skilling setup, use: `+gear skilling`.

Just like dropping a pet ingame and having it follow you, your minion can also equip a pet. This will keep your minion company while it's out working hard to earn you items and gp. To equip a pet, use: `+equippet [pet name]` and it will show on all your gear setups. To unequip it, use: `+unequippet`.

Your equipment stats are displayed on your `+gear [setup]` screen.

##### Gear Presets
Gear presets allow you to save custom gear setups and equip all items with a single command so long as you have them in your bank and have not sold them or equipped them in another setup. Currently, there is one global preset "graceful" which can be used to equip the base graceful outfit. 

To see what gear presets you currently have, you can use the `+gearpresets` command. To save a gear preset, you use the `+gearpresets new (name) (setup)` command. You can delete a gear preset using the `+gearpresets delete (name)` command. To equip on of the global or custom gear presets, you `+gearpresets equip (name) (setup)`, for example, `+gearpresets equip graceful skilling` would equip the global preset of the full graceful outfit in your skilling setup. 

## Agility
You can train Agility using `+laps [quantity] <course>`, for example `+laps 10 canifis`.  

Agility rewards you with marks of grace which you can use to buy Graceful equipment using the command `+create graceful` or `+create graceful (piece)`.

You can get started by using the `+sepulchre` command, with a base agility level of 52 being required. The rewards increase the higher level floor you can reach, as will the number of hallowed marks you will obtain. 

Items from the sepulchre shop can speed up your performance, as well as the Strange Old Lockpick and the Ring of Endurance, both of which are obtainable from the sepulchre itself and provide respective boosts of 1% and 4%.

#### Brimhaven Agility
An alternative form of agility training is to use the `+agilityarena`. While your minion will take some time to learn the ins and outs of the agility arena, this minigame can be quite rewarding, providing agility arena tickets which can be turned in for additional agility xp, a graceful recolour, herbs, and even a Pirate's hook! If you have the stats for the Karamja Medium diary, your xp from obstacles and from turning in tickets will be increased by 10%. If you have the stats for the Karamja Elite diary, you will get 10% more tickets from the minigame.

`+smelt [quantity] <bar>`, for example `+smelt 50 bronze bar`

Fighting the Wintertodt provides item rewards scales to your Woodcutting, Mining, Fishing, Farming, Crafting, and Herblore levels, and xp scaled to your Firemaking level. You need level 50 Firemaking to challenge the Wintertodt, and each attempt requires food to heal yourself from the Wintertodt's attacks. You will automatically use lower quality food first. The speed at which you challenge the Wintertodt increases with a higher Woodcutting level, and the food required is reduced for every piece of the pyromancer outfit you have equipped in your skilling setup, as well other items of [warm clothing](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Wintertodt/Warm_clothing).

Click [here](https://i.imgur.com/iJuoDbb.png) for **Cooking** XP rates.

## Crafting
You can train Crafting with the `+tan` and `+craft` command. For example, `+craft 100 leather gloves`. To start training Crafting, you will probably want to first kill cows for cowhide, then turn the cowhide into leather using `+tan leather`, then craft leather gloves from those. Alternatively, you can also buy these items from our grand-exchange channel.

To see all the items you can craft, check the [Crafting Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crafting) - most of the items are in the bot, with the exact same level and item requirements.

## Prayer
You can train Prayer by burying bones, or offering them to the Chaos altar. For example to bury 100 Dragon bones, you can do `+bury 100 Dragon bones`, or to bury the maximum amount you can: `+bury Dragon bones`. Offering the bones to the Chaos altar works exactly the same, except you use `+offer` instead, for example: `+offer 100 Dragon bones`.

The Chaos Altar works like ingame, your minion will do 1 inventory trips back and forth to sacrifice, with a 10% chance of being PKed in the trip and losing some amount of your inventory of bones (depending on if you got PKed at the start/middle/finish).

The Prayer skill is also required for creating Spirit shields.

## Fletching

You can train Fletching with the `+fletch` command. For example, `+fletch 10000 adamant dart`. To start off training Fletching, you will want to `+chop` some logs for arrow shafts, and then `+fletch arrow shaft` them into arrow shafts. Alternativley, you can buy logs or unfinished fletching supplies from our #grand-exchange channel in the support server. 

To see all the items you can fletch, check out the [Fletching Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fletching) - most of the items found there are fletchable in the bot, having the exact same level and item requirements. 

## Thieving

You can train thieving using the `+pickpocket` command. For example, you can `+pickpocket master farmer`. To start training Thieving, you can `+pickpocket man` or `woman`. You will obtain the standard loot from each monster you can pickpocket, all of which can be found on the [OSRS Thieving Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Thieving).

### Thievable NPCs
| **NPC Name** | **Required level** |
| - | :-: |
| Man/Woman | 1 |

### Pyramid Plunder
You can challenge the thieving minigame Pyramid Plunder for good, high level thieving xp and a chance to obtain the Pharaoh's sceptre. The sceptre and graceful provide boosts to your time spent in this minigame, and it is highly recommended that you wait until at least level 71 thieving, though you only need a base thieving level of 21. Outside of the sceptre, the pyramid also drops small trinkets which can be sold to the bot for gp. 

## Farming
Farming in the bot works like farming ingame, where you will send your minion off on plating and/or harvesting trips, and your crops will grow in the background as you do other activities. The number of patches you have available will increase with the number of quest points you have and your farming level.

To plant crops, you can use the `+plant <name>` or `+farm <name>` commands. When a crop is fully grown, you can either use the `+harvest <name>` command, which will leave your patches empty, or the `+plant` or `+farm` commands which will plant whatever new crop you specify.

Some crops can be protected when planted using the `--pay` flag on the end of your farming command. Protection costs can be found on the [Farming training](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Farming_training) page of the OSRS Wiki. Protecting your crops will prevent them from dying at all, and most crops can be both protected and composted, if you wish to stack their properties. These payment bundles can be created using the `+create` command and works for most common crops such as potatoes, tomatoes, strawberries, bananas, oranges, etc, and are often taken in groups of 5 or 10. 

You can set crop payment and compost to apply automatically using the `+defaultfarming tier compost/supercompost/ultracompost` and `+defaultfarming pay enable/disable` commands.

You can make supercompost from watermelons using the `+compostbin watermelon` command. Otherwise supercompost can be obtained from drops by wilderness bosses. 

#### Farming Payment Creatables

| Onions(10) | 10 Onion |

When harvesting trees, you will either need the woodcutting level necessary to chop down the tree (which will award logs), or if you lack the necessary woodcutting level, 200gp for a farmer to remove the tree for you (which will not award logs). 

Compost is buyable from the game shop using the `+buy` command, and is automatically applied to your crops if you have any available. If you have supercompost or ultracompost, you can use their respective flags (`--supercompost` and `--ultracompost`) to add them to your crops when planting. Ultracompost can be created by combining supercompost with volcanic ash, which you can mine with 22 Mining. Compost decreases the death chances for your crops as they grow and increases some crop yields, so it can be very useful to get the most out of your seeds. 

### Farming Contracts
An easy way to get additional seeds while farming is to take on a [farming contract](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Guildmaster_Jane#Farming_contracts) from Farming Guildmaster Jane using the `+farmingcontract <tier>` command. You can take easy contracts at 45 Farming, medium contracts at 65 Farming, and hard contracts at 85 Farming. Guildmaster Jane will ask you to grow a crop suitable for your farming level, and upon successfully harvesting the requested crop you will be given a seed pack. If your contract is too difficult, you can use the `+fc easier` command to have Jane downgrade your contract to the next lowest tier. After completing your contract, you must use the `+seedpack` command to get your rewards. 

### Tithe Farm
The [Tithe Farm](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tithe_Farm) is a Farming minigame where you earn points which can be used to purchase the Farmers outfit and grape seeds, and is unlocked with 34 Farming. Your minion will go out and actively participate in this minigame getting you points and farming xp, with the time taken decreasing with your minigame kc and a flat 10% time reduction from the graceful set.

#### Tithe Farm Shop
| **Item name** | **Point cost** |
| - | :-: |
| Farmers strawhat | 75 |
| Farmers jacket/shirt | 150 |
| Farmers boro trousers | 125 |
| Farmers boots | 50 |
| Grape seed | 2 |
| Supercompost | 5 |
| Bologa's Blessing (x10) | 1 |


#### Farming Boosts
The speed of your farming trips and the xp you gain from farming activities can both be boosted, as well as the quantity of items harvested. The following items provide boosts to the farming skill:

* Farmers Strawhat = +0.4% to XP
* Farmers Jacket/Shirt = +0.8% to XP
* Farmers Boro Trousers + +0.6% to XP
* Farmers Boots = +0.2% to XP

## Herblore
Herblore works as it does in OSRS: you clean herbs, make unfinished potions, prepare your secondary ingredients, and then make your final potions. In order to start training herblore, you need 10 qp to get the starting xp from the Druidic Ritual quest which will take you to level 3 herblore. If you did not have 10 qp when Herblore was released, you will have a 50% chance of getting the starting xp when questing post 10 qp. Making unfinished potions and preparing secondary ingredients provide no xp, cleaning herbs provides a little xp, and the bulk of your xp will be gotten from creating your final potions. Herblore uses the `+mix`, `+clean`, and `+crush` commands. Making unfinished potions, cleaning herbs, and preparing secondary ingredients can all be done by hand, but takes time. If you have the gp, you can pay Zahur to `+clean` your herbs or `+mix` your unfinished potions for 200 gp per herb or potion using the `--zahur` flag. To crush secondary ingredients, you can pay Wesley to do it for you using the `--wesley` flag for 50 gp per item. 

All potions in OSRS are available to be made in the bot, however ingredients may not be easy or currently possible to obtain. You can see the levels required to clean herbs and make potions on the OSRS Wiki [Level up table page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Herblore/Level_up_table). Zuhar will not clean herbs for you if you do not have the required herblore level to clean them yourself. Welsey will crush any item you need as there is no level requirement to process secondary ingredients.

## Construction
It's free real estate. Literally, a house is provided, so get building! Construction in the bot is a paired down version of construction in OSRS, with more limited options designed to hit on the things with the most utility either for training or for aiding you in completing other content, with some cosmetics retained to spice up your house. Construction in the bot has three distinct parts: **Training**, **Mahogany Homes**, and your **Player-owned House**. Standard training requires planks, which can be made from normal, oak, teak, and mahogany logs using the `+sawmill <logs>` command, Mahogany Homes requires planks and steel bars, and building things in your PoH requires planks as well as various mob drops or buyables. 

You can also `+offer` curved bones and long bones you get from PvM for construction xp after level 30 construction. Fighting the Wintertodt also provides some construction xp. 

### Training
Standard training offers the fastest methods for training construction in the bot, and also uses the most planks. When building these items, they do not appear in your PoH, and currently have no functionality outside of being the best xp per hour. You can do normal construction training using the `+build <item>` command. 

#### Standard Construction Training Table
| **Item** | **Required level** | **Planks needed** |
| - | :-: | :-: |
| Crude wooden chair | 1 | 2 Planks |
| Wooden bookcase | 4 | 4 Planks |
| Wooden chair | 8 | 3 Planks |
| Wooden larder | 9 | 8 Planks |
| Wood dining table | 10 | 4 Planks |
| Rocking chair | 14 | 3 Planks |
| Repair bench | 15 | 2 Oak planks |
| Crafting table 1 | 16 | 4 Oak planks |
| Oak chair | 19 | 2 Oak planks |
| Oak dining table | 22 | 4 Oak planks |
| Oak armchair | 26 | 3 Oak planks |
| Carved oak table | 31 | 6 Oak planks |
| Oak larder | 33 | 8 Oak planks |
| Teak armchair | 35 | 2 Teak planks |
| Teak table | 38 | 4 Teak planks |
| Mahogany armchair | 50 | 2 Mahogany planks |
| Mahogany table | 52 | 6 Mahogny planks |
| Teak garden bench | 66 | 6 Teak planks |
| Oak door | 74 | 10 Oak planks |
| Gnome bench | 77 | 6 Mahogany planks |

### Mahogany Homes
Mahogany Homes is the construction minigame and it provides more xp per plank as well as some rewards which will improve your construction experience. To start a contract, use the `+mh build` command. Beginner contracts are available from level 1 to level 19, award 2 points per contract, and use normal planks. Novice contracts are available from level 10 to level 49, award 3 points per contract, and use oak planks. Adept contracts are available from level 50 to level 69, award 4 points per contract, and use teak planks. Expert contracts are available at level 70, award 5 points per contract, and use mahogany planks. All contracts use a random amount of steel bars and planks scaling with the number of contracts you are completing in a trip. The points gained from this minigame can be spent on a variety of items which will help train construction, provide you construction resources, fill your collection log, or are simply cosmetic. You can buy these items with the `+mh buy <item>` command. 

#### Mahogany Homes Buyables
| **Item** | **Point cost** | **Use** |
| - | :-: | :-: |
| Builders supply crate | 25 | Provides construction materials when opened |
| Amy's saw | 500 | Cosmetic saw |
| Plank sack | 350 | Construction xp boost |
| Hosidius blueprints | 2000 | PoH recolour |
| Carpenter's helmet | 400 | 0.4% construction xp boost |
| Carpenter's shirt | 800 | 0.8% construction xp boost |
| Carpenter's trousers | 600 | 0.6% construction xp boost |
| Carpenter's boots | 200 | 0.2% construction xp boost |

And the full carpenter's outfit boosts construction xp by an additional 0.5% for a total set bonus of 2.5%. 

### Player-owned House
When building your PoH, no construction xp is awarded, but your PoH can provide some great boots as well as being able to use the image generated by the `+poh` command to flex on your friends. There are 13 different object spaces in your PoH, all of which have a bunch of different items you can build in them. Currently, the only item which provides a boost is the Rejuvination pool which is built in the pool space, but other items will be made useful in teh future. Not all items that have been coded are currently able to be built, but that will change as more updates are made to the bot. For a full list of items which can be build in each space, use the `+poh items` command. Your PoH is where your minion lives when not out working for you, so make sure to give it a good home!

If you have 99 construction, you can `+PoH build item mount` and then `+PoH mountitem` any item you own in your PoH to display to the world. This item is refunded if you ever want to switch it out for something else, though the magic stones required to mount the item itself are not. 

If you have the Hosidious blueprints from the mahogany homes minigame, you can modify the wallkit for your house using the `+PoH wallkit hosidious` command. This will permanently unlock this wallkit for your PoH, and more may be added in the future. 

## Hunter
From copper longtails to black chinchompas, use the hunter skill to track, trap, and catch a variety of critters. Though they're animals, they aren't stupid, and it will take some time to learn the most efficient ways to `+hunt` them, with a 10% maximum boost after 50 hours at a given creature. For a full list of creatures, you can use the `+hunt --creatures` command. Each creature also has a `+lb creatures` so you can see how you stack up against your fellow players. For example, to see the top black chinchompa hunters in OSB, you can `+lb creatures black chinchompa`. Make sure to have a set of graceful equipped in your skilling setup, as it provides boosts for certain creatures. Stamina potion (4)s will aid you in hunting the Herbiboar as well, and if you ever lack the level requirement for a creature, you can use the `--potion` flag to use hunter potion (4)s to boost if you have them.

A warning, black chin and black salamander hunting is dangerous! These wilderness creatures will put you in the path of virtual PKers, who may attack you, causing you to lose potions, catch chances, or even your minion's gear! A failed PK attempt will see you lose some saradomin brews and super restores, as well as lose some of your maximum catch chances. If the PKer kills you, you will lose some of the creatures you were catching, pots, as well as the body and leg slot items in your misc gear setup. While those two items are risked, their defensive stats also help you escape PKers, so it may be worth the risk.

Beyond the standard `+hunt` command, there are two additional forms of hunter: aerial fishing and birdhouses. Aerial fishing gives both fishing and hunter experience, as well as a rare chance at molch pears that you can use to purchase various skilling items. Rates improve with higher hunter and fishing levels as new `+aerialfish` targets are unlocked. Birdhouses are a passive way to earn hunter xp, and also provide bird nests which are useful for training herblore. Birdhouse runs need birdhouses, which can be crafted, and seeds to use as bait. To do a birdhouse run, use the `+birdhouse run` command followed by the type of birdhouse you want to use (e.g. maple birdhouse). To check the status of your birdhouses you can use the `+birdhouse check` command. 

#### Aerial Fishing Buyables
| **Item** | **Molch pearl cost** |
| - | :-: |
| Angler hat | 100 |
| Angler top | 100 |
| Angler waders | 100 |
| Angler boots | 100 |
| Pearl fishing rod | 100 |
| Pearl fly fishing rod | 120 |
| Pearl barbarian rod | 150 |
| Fish sack | 1000 |

## Magic
Yer a wizard, or at least your minion is. Currently, you can cast *non-combat magic spells* like alching, enchanting, and certain utility spells like teleports. To start off the magic skill, you need to quest to get initial levels. If you had quest point progression before the magic skill, you may already have the starter levels out of the way. All spells require the same levels they require in OSRS. Bolt and jewellrey enchanting have variable level requirements depending on what type of object you're trying to enchant, and you can see all of your different options and the levels at which they become unlocked using the `+enchant --items` command. You can also `+cast` bones to bananas at level 15, the Varrock teleport at level 25, the Camelot teleport at level 45, and use high level alchemy at level 55. All spells require runes, but you can cut down on the rune cost by equipping an [elemental stave](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Elemental_staves) in your skilling setup, which will provide infinite elemental runes depending on the type of staff you equip. 

With the magic skill, the Fountain of Rune is open for limited use in charging your amulets of glory using the `+chargeglories (quantity)` command. Your minion will do full inventories of 26 glories, and will have a small chance of being PK'd and losing your full inventory. If you have all the stats required for the wilderness elite diary, including the 96 magic requirement, you will have a 3x boost when chanrging glories. It is **not** recommended to charge amulets of glory without the wilderness elite diary. Charging amulets of glory in this way provides a small change to give you an amulet of eternal glory, which will never run out of charges. 

## Questing
Questing in the bot is simple and easy, and roughly 20% faster than ingame. Instead of doing specific quests, you just "quest" and gain QP for "questing". You can keep questing until you reach the max QP. The amount of QP you recieve per trip scales down as you progress, with averages of 4 QP/hr from 0 to 100 QP, 3 QP/hr from 100-200 QP, and 2 QP/hr from 200-279 QP. 

Quest points are required to kill some bosses (e.g. Vorkath) and required to buy some items (e.g. Barrows gloves).

Questing recieves a 10% boost if you have the full Graceful outfit equipped in your skilling gear setup.

## Skillcapes

Upon reaching level 99 in a skill, you can purchase a skillcape for 99k by typing `+skillcape <skill_name>`. If it's your first 99, you'll get an untrimmed cape.

## Warriors Guild

You can use the Warriors Guild to get defenders, powerful offensive offhand slot items. You can use sets of black, mithril, adamant, or rune armour to earn guild tokens using the `+wg tokens` command. Once you have tokens, you can fight the cyclops housed in the guild to earn bronze through dragon defenders using the `+wg cyclops` command. 

## Barbarian Assault

Challenge waves of penance monsters with a teammate to unlock the rewards from Barbarian Assault. BA in the bot works a bit differently than BA in OSRS as it was modified to be easier to find teams and earn points. The `+BA start` command will begin a two minute timer during which the other member of your group can join using the emoji interface. There are no defined roles or role-specific honour levels, there aren't even specific waves. At random, one member of the team will be selected as the Fighter, and that member's melee strength bonus will provide an overall boost to your time spent per wave. Boosts are also provided based on total team honour level and BA killcount. If you have the stats required for the Kandarin Hard diary, you will get an additional 10% honour points. 

To spend your honour points, you can `+BA buy` the items in the table below, `+BA level` to increase your honour level up to level 5, or `+ba gamble low/medium/high` and try your luck at the random rolls of the BA gambling table.

#### Barbarian Assault Shop
| **Item** | **Honour pount cost** |
| - | :-: |
| Fighter hat | 1100 |
| Ranger hat | 1100 |
| Healer hat | 1100 |
| Runner hat | 1100 |
| Fighter torso | 1500 |
| Penance skirt | 1500 |
| Runner boots | 400 |
| Penance gloves | 600 |
| Low gamble | 200 |
| Medium gamble | 400 |
| High gamble | 500 |

## Zalcano
Are you ready to take on the demon underneath Prifddinas? Defeating Zalcano gives plenty of loot, with many gems, ores and bars to be stacked up. Zalcano has a requirement of 70 mining and smithing. There are several boosts for Zalcano, with a small boost for extra mining and smithing levels, up to 4.95% with both 99 mining and smithing. Minion learning provides a maximum 16.67% boost as well as a -10% penalty for not having graceful equipped in the skilling gear setup. Zalcano also uses food, however, only a small amount in comparison to other activities. 

Zalcano can be started by using the `+zalcano` command. 

## Champions' Challenge
Do you have what it takes to become the champion? Once you have collected one of every champion scroll from mobs across the bot, you can undertake the champions' challenge! Using the `+cc` command, you can obtain the Champion's cape, an extremely rare item that will signal to other players you are a champion over many varied monsters.

## Gnome Restaurant 
Order up! Help the gnomes prepare food and make deliveries in this minigame that you can run using the `+gnomerestaurant` command. It is a farily slow minigame, so it is recommended that you have some of the boosts which will make things much smoother. Boosts are gained through experience at the minigame (up to 20% at 100 kc), having full graceful in your skilling setup (25%), having level 66 magic or greater for teleports (25%), and for having teleportation jewellery in your bank. For the jewellery, you can have boosts for either the Amulet of glory (6), the Games necklace (8), or the Ring of dueling (8) in your bank, and the game will randomly select one of the three to check for and consume. An amulet of eternal glory will not be lost, and all amulets of glory (6) will be returned as an amulet of glory without charges. However, the ring of dueling or the games necklace will be consumed if selected.

# Minion Icons

You can sacrifice items, and their GP value will go towards you unlocking new minion icons. You will automatically receive the icon immediately after sacrificing enough GP. You can see a leaderboard of who has sacrificed the most using `+lb sacrifice`.

You can sacrifice items using `+sacrifice [quantity] <item>`, like `+sacrifice Bandos chestplate` or `+sacrifice 1000 gold ore`. You cannot sacrifice GP, instead you should buy items off other players with your GP and sacrifice those.
