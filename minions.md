Minions are a feature in Old School Bot that let you simulate playing a virtual runescape account in discord. You control a minion, who you send out to do various tasks, like killing monsters for loot, completing clue scrolls, and training skills. With the loot they get, you can craft items, sell them and trade to other real players.

> Minions are entirely virtual, and not in any way tradeable for real GP or real money. It's simulating the real game for fun. We strictly do not allow any bot users to break any of the official OSRS rules. Read the rules here: [Old School Bot Rules](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/rules)
