# Ironman-mode

You can become an Ironman using `+m ironman` - this will reset your entire account, to a fresh start, so you can play as an ironman.

You can make your ironman a _permanent_ ironman using `+m ironman --permanent`.

You're allowed to have an ironman account and a non-ironman account. However, this requires you to run 2 discord accounts, and is only if you want to.
