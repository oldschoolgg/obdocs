# Fight Caves

## Overview

You can challenge the Fight Caves and TzTok-Jad to receive a fire cape, tokkul, and the TzRek-Jad pet. The number of total attempts you have made will largely determine your chances of killing Jad when he is reached (starting at a mere 0.9% survival chance).

Better range gear will reduce the time each attempt takes at a rate of roughly 1% per 5 attack value, as will total Jad kc. You can equip your best ranged gear with the autoequip command `/gear equip`` `**`gear_setup:`**` ``Range`` `**`auto:`**` ``ranged_strength`\
\
You require 4 dose potions for the fight, so, decent 3, 2, and 1 dose pots using the `/decant` command. Should you fail before the final wave, some of your potions will be refunded.

Tokkul gained from completions can be spent at the [Tokkul shop](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/bosses/fight-caves/tokkul-shop).
