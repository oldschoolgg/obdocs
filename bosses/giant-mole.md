# Giant Mole

You can turn in mole parts for nest boxes with the `/sell` command. To sell all at once, don't include any number.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Mole claw.png>) `/sell`` `**`items:`**` ``50 mole claw`\
``![](<../.gitbook/assets/Mole skin.png>)`/sell`` `**`items:`**` ``100 mole skin`

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is <mark style="color:red;">NO COMFIRMATION</mark> for this /sell command.
{% endhint %}

You can also use `/sell`` `**`filter:`**`mole` to sell all at once.

See [Boosts & Requirements page](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/bosses/boosts-and-requirements) for gear.
